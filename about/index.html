  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
  I live in the Philippines. I studied Computer Science in college. I competed in an ACM ICPC contest before, and I still compete in Google CodeJam and Facebook Hacker Cup. In my free time I volunteer at <a href="http://bicolit.org">BicolIT.org</a> where we organize some cool events. I currently write software for <a href="http://typejump.com">Typejump</a>. I have done startups, outsourcing and government work before. Just like every other kid growing up in the Philippines, I like basketball(not that I'm great at it).

  I'm interested in HTML5, Sport Programming, Game Development, System Administration, Node.js and Haskell. If you want to talk, check out my <a href="/contacts">contacts</a> page.
